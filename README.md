# Number To LCD

Write a program that given a number (with arbitrary number of digits), converts it into LCD style numbers using the following format:
```
   _  _     _  _  _  _  _  
 | _| _||_||_ |_   ||_||_|  
 ||_  _|  | _||_|  ||_| _|  

(each digit is 3 lines high)
```

Additionally support variable width or height of the digits. For example for width = 3 and height = 2 the digit 2 will be:
```
 ___
    |
 ___|

|___
```
